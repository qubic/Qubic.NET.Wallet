1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,287
The encrypted vault is one of the most important features in the Qubic dot Net Wallet.

2
00:00:05,237 --> 00:00:12,512
It lets you store multiple seeds and an address book in a single encrypted file, protected by a password you choose.

3
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,587
Let's create a vault.

4
00:00:14,587 --> 00:00:17,450
Enter a file path for the vault file.

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:23,550
Then enter the seed you want to store, give it a label like Main Wallet, and set a strong password.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,575
Click Create Vault.

7
00:00:25,575 --> 00:00:32,900
The wallet creates an AES-256-GCM encrypted file using Argon2id for key derivation.

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,587
This is the gold standard for password-based encryption.

9
00:00:36,587 --> 00:00:39,400
Your vault can hold multiple seeds.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,525
Let's add a second one.

11
00:00:41,525 --> 00:00:48,462
Click Generate to create a fresh seed, give it a label — for example, Trading — and click Add Entry.

12
00:00:48,462 --> 00:00:51,262
The vault now holds two identities.

13
00:00:51,262 --> 00:00:56,950
You can switch between them instantly from the top bar dropdown — no need to re-enter seeds.

14
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,262
Now let's add some contacts to the address book.

15
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:04,887
Enter a label and an identity address, then click Add Contact.

16
00:01:04,887 --> 00:01:14,650
Saved contacts appear as autocomplete suggestions in every address field across the app — Send, Send to Many, Assets, QX Trading, everywhere.

17
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,662
You can also save addresses on the fly.

18
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:23,575
After a successful transaction, the wallet offers to save the destination as a contact.

19
00:01:23,575 --> 00:01:27,237
To secure your vault, click Lock in the top bar.

20
00:01:27,237 --> 00:01:29,825
All seeds are cleared from memory.

21
00:01:29,825 --> 00:01:33,850
To resume, enter your vault password and click Unlock.

22
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:39,175
If you enter a seed directly without a vault, the top bar shows a Save to Vault button.

23
00:01:39,175 --> 00:01:45,175
Click it to create a new vault file or add the seed to an existing vault — right from the top bar.

24
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:49,825
You can also change your vault password at any time from the Settings page.
