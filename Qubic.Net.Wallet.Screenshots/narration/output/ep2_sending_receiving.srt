1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:06,475
In this episode, we'll cover sending and receiving QU — the native currency of the Qubic network.

2
00:00:06,425 --> 00:00:08,712
Click Send in the sidebar.

3
00:00:08,712 --> 00:00:12,337
The From field shows your identity and current balance.

4
00:00:12,337 --> 00:00:19,475
Enter the destination identity — you can type it manually, or select from your address book if you've saved contacts.

5
00:00:19,475 --> 00:00:22,125
Enter the amount of QU to send.

6
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:30,200
The quick-fill buttons let you quickly set 10%, 25%, 50%, or 100% of your balance.

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,075
The Target Tick is set automatically.

8
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:38,800
The wallet picks the current tick plus an offset to give the network time to process your transaction.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,575
Click Preview Transaction to review the details — destination, amount, and tick.

10
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:47,312
Now click Sign and Broadcast.

11
00:00:47,312 --> 00:00:52,337
The wallet signs the transaction locally with your seed and sends it to the network.

12
00:00:52,337 --> 00:00:56,637
You'll see the transaction ID and a link to track it in your history.

13
00:00:56,637 --> 00:01:02,575
If the destination address isn't in your address book, the wallet offers to save it as a contact.

14
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:05,400
Next, let's look at Send to Many.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:13,962
This feature lets you send QU to up to 25 recipients in a single transaction, using the QUTIL Send To Many V1 contract.

16
00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:18,175
Add recipients one by one — each with an address and amount.

17
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:25,737
Or click Import from Text to paste a list of addresses and amounts, one per line, separated by commas or tabs.

18
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:30,962
If you have a vault set up, you can save the current recipient list as a named template.

19
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:36,900
This is handy for recurring payments — load a template, adjust amounts if needed, and send.

20
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,900
Review the total, sign, and broadcast — just like a single send.

21
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,125
Finally, let's visit the Receive page.

22
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:48,312
It displays your identity as a QR code.

23
00:01:48,312 --> 00:01:51,312
Anyone can scan this to get your address.

24
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:55,837
Below the QR code is your full identity in a copyable format.

25
00:01:55,837 --> 00:02:04,562
Click Copy Address to copy it, or Copy QR to copy the QR code image to your clipboard — handy for pasting into a chat or document.
