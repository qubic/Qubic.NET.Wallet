00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:07,362
In this episode, we'll cover the DeFi features — QSwap, QEarn staking, and MSVault multi-signature.

2
00:00:07,312 --> 00:00:10,812
QSwap is the automated market maker on Qubic.

3
00:00:10,812 --> 00:00:16,075
You can create liquidity pools, add or remove liquidity, and swap tokens.

4
00:00:16,075 --> 00:00:23,637
The tabs let you issue new pool tokens, transfer them, create pools, manage liquidity, and perform swaps.

5
00:00:23,637 --> 00:00:28,925
Select an asset, choose your swap direction, enter amounts, and click Swap.

6
00:00:28,925 --> 00:00:32,225
The interface handles the contract calls for you.

7
00:00:32,225 --> 00:00:35,337
Next is QEarn — the staking feature.

8
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:40,550
QEarn lets you lock QU for staking rewards over a 52-week period.

9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:49,712
The staking summary shows all your active locks — the epoch, amount, current week, estimated reward, and an early unlock option for each.

10
00:00:49,712 --> 00:00:54,325
To stake, go to the Lock tab, enter an amount, and click Lock.

11
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:58,912
Your QU is locked for 52 weeks, earning yield each week.

12
00:00:58,912 --> 00:01:02,462
You can unlock early, but the reward is reduced.

13
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:12,225
The Query tab lets you explore staking data — lock info per epoch, your lock status as a visual 52-week bitmask, global stats, and more.

14
00:01:12,225 --> 00:01:16,737
Finally, MSVault provides multi-signature vaults on Qubic.

15
00:01:16,737 --> 00:01:23,562
Multiple owners must approve before funds can be released — making it ideal for teams and organizations.

16
00:01:23,562 --> 00:01:29,225
The top panel shows your vaults with balances, owner counts, and required approvals.

17
00:01:29,225 --> 00:01:32,850
Pending releases show who has approved and who hasn't.

18
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,125
To create a vault, go to the Register tab.

19
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:41,950
Enter a name, add owner addresses, set the number of required approvals, and register.

20
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:47,112
Use the Deposit tab to fund the vault, and the Release tab to propose a withdrawal.

21
00:01:47,112 --> 00:01:50,575
Other owners approve releases from their own wallets.

22
00:01:50,575 --> 00:01:54,125
Once the threshold is met, the funds are released.
