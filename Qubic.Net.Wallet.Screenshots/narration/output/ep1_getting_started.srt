00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,937
Welcome to the Qubic dot Net Wallet.

2
00:00:02,887 --> 00:00:11,000
In this episode, we'll set up a new wallet from scratch — generating a seed, connecting to the network, and exploring the dashboard.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,812
The Qubic dot Net Wallet runs as a native desktop application on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

4
00:00:17,812 --> 00:00:21,212
It can also run in your browser using server mode.

5
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:23,562
This is the main interface.

6
00:00:23,562 --> 00:00:27,975
On the left you have the navigation sidebar with links to every feature.

7
00:00:27,975 --> 00:00:32,537
At the top is the seed bar — where you'll enter or unlock your identity.

8
00:00:32,537 --> 00:00:34,750
Let's create a new wallet.

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,762
On the Home page, you'll see a Get Started panel and a Create New Wallet panel.

10
00:00:39,762 --> 00:00:42,025
Click Generate New Seed.

11
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:46,275
The wallet creates a random 55-character lowercase seed.

12
00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:51,362
This seed is your master key — it controls your identity and all your funds.

13
00:00:51,362 --> 00:00:56,662
Click the eye icon to reveal the seed, and the copy button to copy it to your clipboard.

14
00:00:56,662 --> 00:01:01,175
Important: Write down your seed on paper and store it somewhere safe.

15
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:04,712
If you lose your seed, your funds are gone forever.

16
00:01:04,712 --> 00:01:06,975
Never share it with anyone.

17
00:01:06,975 --> 00:01:10,437
Check the confirmation box and click Use This Seed.

18
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:14,600
Your identity is now active — you can see it in the top bar.

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,187
The truncated identity address is shown as a badge.

20
00:01:18,187 --> 00:01:21,700
Click it to copy the full 60-character address.

21
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,625
Now let's connect to the Qubic network.

22
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:27,375
The wallet supports three backends.

23
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:33,712
RPC connects to a Qubic RPC server — this is the default and recommended for most users.

24
00:01:33,712 --> 00:01:37,025
Bob connects to a Bob JSON-RPC node.

25
00:01:37,025 --> 00:01:42,650
And Direct connects to a Qubic node via TCP — the most decentralized option.

26
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,925
Select your preferred backend and click Connect.

27
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:50,562
The current epoch and tick appear in the top bar, confirming you're connected.

28
00:01:50,562 --> 00:01:55,362
Once connected with an active seed, the Home page becomes your dashboard.

29
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:59,162
At the top you see your full identity and QU balance.

30
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:01,887
Click Load Balance to refresh it.

31
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:08,275
Below that are Quick Action buttons for Send, Receive, Assets, QX Trading, and History.

32
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:16,850
The dashboard also shows your owned assets and any open orders on the QX exchange — giving you a snapshot of your portfolio at a glance.

33
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,087
That's it for getting started.

34
00:02:19,087 --> 00:02:24,025
You now have a wallet with an active identity, connected to the Qubic network.
