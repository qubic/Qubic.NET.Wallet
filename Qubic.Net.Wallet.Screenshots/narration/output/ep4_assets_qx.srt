00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:06,300
In this episode, we'll explore the Assets page and QX — Qubic's decentralized exchange.

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,062
The Assets page shows all tokens owned by an identity.

3
00:00:10,062 --> 00:00:13,912
Enter any identity address and click Lookup Assets.

4
00:00:13,912 --> 00:00:19,600
You'll see three categories: Owned assets, Possessed assets, and Issued assets.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:30,212
For your own assets, you can directly place sell or buy orders, transfer to another address, view the order book, or manage rights — all from action buttons on each row.

6
00:00:30,212 --> 00:00:34,062
Click Orders to view the live order book for any asset.

7
00:00:34,062 --> 00:00:37,200
The asks and bids are shown side by side.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,750
Click a row to pre-fill a trade.

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,312
Now let's move to QX Trading.

10
00:00:42,312 --> 00:00:47,750
QX is the Qubic decentralized exchange, and this page gives you full access.

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,112
At the top, you see your open orders with cancel buttons for each.

12
00:00:52,112 --> 00:00:54,800
The tabs give you everything you need.

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,187
Issue lets you create a new asset with a name, supply, and decimal places.

14
00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:03,825
Transfer lets you send assets to another address.

15
00:01:03,825 --> 00:01:07,187
Ask lets you place a sell order at your price.

16
00:01:07,187 --> 00:01:09,650
Bid lets you place a buy order.

17
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,050
The total cost is calculated automatically.

18
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,800
And Rights lets you transfer asset management rights to a smart contract.

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:25,975
Below the tabs is the Market Overview — a table showing every traded asset with the best ask, best bid, depth, and spread.
