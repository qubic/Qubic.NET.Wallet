00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:08,112
In this episode, we'll explore transaction history and log events — the tools for monitoring your activity on the Qubic network.

2
00:00:08,062 --> 00:00:10,962
Transaction History has two tabs.

3
00:00:10,962 --> 00:00:18,875
The Tracked tab shows transactions you've made from this wallet, with live status updates — Pending, Confirmed, or Failed.

4
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:22,187
Each transaction shows its current status.

5
00:00:22,187 --> 00:00:26,975
Pending means the transaction has been broadcast but not yet confirmed.

6
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:30,162
Confirmed means the network has processed it.

7
00:00:30,162 --> 00:00:32,950
And Failed means it didn't execute.

8
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:44,062
Expand any transaction to see full details — the destination, amount, tick, raw transaction data, and a Repeat Transaction button to re-send with the same parameters.

9
00:00:44,062 --> 00:00:50,175
The All Transactions tab shows your complete history synced from the network — both sent and received.

10
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:55,812
You can filter by direction, type, or tick range to find specific transactions.

11
00:00:55,812 --> 00:00:58,275
Now let's look at Log Events.

12
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:04,475
This page shows contract-level events for your identity — detailed logs synced from the Bob backend.

13
00:01:04,475 --> 00:01:08,725
Each event has a type badge, amounts, and raw body data.

14
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:16,100
This is useful for tracking contract interactions like staking rewards, asset transfers, and DEX trades.

15
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:24,175
Together, Transaction History and Log Events give you full visibility into everything happening with your identity on the Qubic network.
