00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,525
In this final episode, we'll cover the Sign and Verify tool and the wallet settings.

2
00:00:05,475 --> 00:00:11,937
Sign and Verify lets you cryptographically sign messages with your seed and verify signatures from others.

3
00:00:11,937 --> 00:00:14,375
Type a message and click Sign.

4
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:20,825
The wallet produces a JSON object containing your identity, the message, and the digital signature.

5
00:00:20,825 --> 00:00:26,237
Share this to prove you control the identity — useful for authentication or agreements.

6
00:00:26,237 --> 00:00:31,512
To verify someone else's signature, paste the signed JSON and click Verify.

7
00:00:31,512 --> 00:00:36,100
The wallet checks the cryptographic signature and tells you whether it's valid.

8
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,537
Now let's explore Settings.

9
00:00:38,537 --> 00:00:41,400
Settings is organized into tabs.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,862
General lets you switch between Light and Dark theme.

11
00:00:44,862 --> 00:00:53,375
Connection lets you configure your default backend — RPC, Bob, or Direct — along with the server URLs and direct node address.

12
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:59,625
Transactions lets you adjust the auto-tick offset and enable auto-resend for failed transactions.

13
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:04,750
This is useful if your transactions often expire before being processed.

14
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:14,800
Labels lets you toggle remote label resolution, which shows human-readable names for known addresses like exchanges and contracts instead of raw 60-character identities.

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,537
Data lets you export or import your wallet database.

16
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:24,625
The database is encrypted with SQLCipher, keyed to your seed, so only you can read it.

17
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:33,125
And the Vault tab lets you manage your encrypted vault file — change its location, update the password, or disconnect from the vault entirely.

18
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:36,362
A few important security notes to close with.

19
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:39,775
Your seed is held in memory only during the session.

20
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:42,625
It is never written to disk unencrypted.

21
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:49,050
The encrypted vault uses AES-256-GCM with Argon2id key derivation.

22
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,800
And in server mode, access is protected by a one-time session token.

23
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,762
But prefer desktop mode when possible.

24
00:01:56,762 --> 00:01:58,875
Never share your seed.

25
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:01,400
Qubic will never ask for it.

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,900
Anyone with your seed has full control of your funds.

27
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,062
Thanks for watching, and welcome to Qubic.
